# Object Detection
## Implementation of Yolo Algorithm: 
 an effictive approach used nowadays by all developers to perfom object detection tasks,
 - Here I have implemented it after reading the paper using some helper metrics that are mentioned in the paper like:
 * Intersection Over Union (IOU) 
 * Non-max Suppression
 * Mean average Precision
 
- Also implemented the loss function which is:

- And then do the training prcess using PyTorch
